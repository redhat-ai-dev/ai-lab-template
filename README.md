## Usage in backstage 

Add the following to your `app-config.yaml` file in your backstage configuration 

``` 
    - type: url
      target:  https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template/blob/main/all.yaml
      rules:
        - allow: [Location, Template]
```

This will add the samples into a set of backstage templates.

## On-prem host support

You need to ensure the on-prem host is being configured in `app-config.yaml` file in your backstage/RHDH configuration 

### Change default host for Git or Quay

[properties](./properties) file holds the default host for GitHub, GitLab and Quay.

Modify the value and run `./generate.sh` will generate new templates with customized default value.

### Provide on-prem host value when create a component

On `Application Repository Information` Page, provide your Git host in the `Repository Server`

**Note:** Please Ensure the correct `Host Type` is selected

## Contributing

The templates are found in [./templates](./templates)  and reference reusable content in [./skeleton](./skeleton).  

The templates are maintained by importing external samples into the software template format. This allows the external samples to be used standalone, developed, and evolved and then imported.

The pipelines are also maintained externally to allow standalone use outside of software templates, as well as evolution of the pipelines in one of more software templates.

To update the templates from these or any new samples you update the list of imported repos and run the following. 


 [./generate.sh](./generate.sh) to generate all the templates before commit to this repository.

 [import-ai-lab-samples](./scripts/import-ai-lab-samples), [import-gitops-template](./scripts/import-gitops-template) and [update-tekton-definition](./scripts/import-gitops-template) take repourl and branch name as ENV when running the scripts. `SAMPLE_REPO`/`GITOPS_REPO`/`PIPELINE_REPO` and `SAMPLE_BRANCH`/`GITOPS_BRANCH`/`PIPELINE_BRANCH` can be set respectively. 



### MacOS 

Due to differences between Linux and MacOS, the GNU version of `sed` is required to be installed.

```
brew install gnu-sed
```
After this, alter PATH. For example, add the following line to your `~/.bash_profile`:
```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```
