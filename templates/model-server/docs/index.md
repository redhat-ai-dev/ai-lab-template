# AI Software Template

This AI Software Template can be used to create a new GitOps deployment repository for a Model Server, No Application. This Software Template does not generate or configure an application. You can utilize this model server with other Software Template like a Chatbot Application for instance.

As a user you will be able to customize each section of the template, such as:

### **Application Information**

- Application name

- Owner

### **Repository Information**

- GitHub/GitLab repository

- Repository owner

- Name and branch for the repository

### **Deployment Information**

- Application deployment namespace
